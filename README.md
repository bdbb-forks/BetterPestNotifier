# BetterPestNotifier
 A customizable 1.8.9 Forge mod that alerts you when Pests enter your Hypixel Skyblock Garden.

This mod plays a sound file when a pest enters your Garden, and a different sound file
when a Pest enters your Garden and you have 4+ pests. Both of these
sound files are customizable, however the sound files have to be of WAV file extension. If they aren't, just use an online converter.

**This mod comes with default sound files and settings so you can jump right in if you don't wanna customize anything.** (Default is anvil sound for Pest, and a text-to-speech alerting you at 4+ pests).
**YOU DONT HAVE TO RESTART YOUR GAME IF YOU CHANGE THE SOUND FILES**
The mod doesn't use Minecraft to play audio, so you can have your Minecraft volume at 0% and it'll work fine.



The sound file that plays when a Pest invades your Garden has to be named "pestNotifier.wav" (.wav being the file extension)
and the sound file that plays when you a Pest invades and you have 4+ pests has to be named "fourPestsNotification.wav"

*These sound files are stored in C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\PestNotifier, the directory is automatically created when you launch the mod for the first time*

**IF YOU DONT WANT A SPECIFIC SOUND TO PLAY, THEN DELETE THAT FILE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU DONT WANT THE SOUND FILE
THAT PLAYS WHEN YOU HAVE 4+ PESTS THEN DELETE IT**

The mod also features some commands, including test commands to simulate what happens when a Pest appears.
To view all commands and their usage, use the command "/pnhelp"

The mod also displays a message when a Pest appears or when you have reached 4+ pests.
I don't know if this happens or not, but if someone that has "Pest" in their username joins your Garden it might trigger the pest notification.
